Project Euler
===============

Here are some working solutions to the Project Euler problems. If you've come here to try and get some quick answers to skip ahead, I must suggest that you *don't read anything else here*. Seriously, you can do it on your own, just keep at it! You wont get anything out of it if you just copy and paste the answers over.

If you absolutely must though, here's what I have so far. A fair warning, a couple of these are slow brute-force scripts, but every solution works.

**PE_01** - Multiples of 3 and 5
**PE_02** - Even fibonacci numbers
**PE_03** - Largest prime factor
**PE_04** - Largest palindrome product
**PE_05** - Smallest multiple
**PE_06** - Sum square difference
**PE_07** - 10001st prime
**PE_08** - Largest product in a series
**PE_09** - Special pythagorean triplet
**PE_10** - Summation of primes
**PE_11** - Largest product in a series
**PE_12** - Highly divisible triangular number
**PE_13** - Large sum
**PE_14** - Longest collatz sequence
