Here are a few simple ruby scripts I made, based on various practice exercises I've come across. 

** Array Sorter ** - Sorts a word-list of any size.

** English Numbers ** - Converts numerals to words, functional range is (+-)2^31 - 1.

** Pig Latin ** - Convert a string to pig latin, obeying all other syntactic and grammatical rules.

** Playlister ** - Scan a folder for music files, create a playlist file. Also does shuffle!

** Romanizer ** - Convert numerals to roman numerals.

** Titlizer ** - Recapitalize a string to match the grammatical rules of book titles and headlines.
